# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend locally by taking turns.
- **Dynamic UI**: The game board updates in real time to reflect the current state of the game.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for a win or draw after each move and declares the result.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work across all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Reset Game**: Easily restart the game with a single click after a win, draw, or if you'd like to play again.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns putting their marks (X or O) in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is declared a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the game.
- **CSS** for styling the game board and layout.
- **JavaScript** for the game logic, including detecting wins, draws, and updating the game board dynamically.
